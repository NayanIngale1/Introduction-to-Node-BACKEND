Consider you have a books API where in you have 3 APIs

GET /books ( has 1 middleware allBooks which prints the console.log ( "Fetching all books")

GET /book/:name ( :name is a variable and we will learn this later in the course but this means if you do book/GameOfThrones or book/HarryPotter then all of them will hit this API so we need a middleware singleBook for this api which will fetch the name of the book and for that you need to do req.params.name ( we will learn this too in future ) and you have to add this book name to the request like req.name = req.params.name and then in the route handler you need to return json like {bookName: req.name}.
