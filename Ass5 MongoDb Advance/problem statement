create a mock movies table in mongodb which has 500 documents which has
following columns/fields ( use mockaroo.com for dummy data ) :-

id
movie_name
movie_genre
production_year ( between 1990 to 2020)
budget( 9000 to 20000)

I want queries for the following in mongo all queries should only return movie_name and production_year

find all movies which are equal to movie_name
find all movies which are not equal to movie_name
find all movies greater than and greater than equal to a budget
find all movies less than and less than equal to a budget
find all movies that are produced after 2000 with budget greater than 10000
find all movies that are produced after 2000 or budget greater than 10000
find all movies that are neither produced after 2000 nor with budget greater than 10000.
find all movies that are not produced in 2000 or they do not have budget of 10000
find all movies that were produced from 2000 to 2010.
Sort all movies descending based on the production year and if the year is same then alphabetically for their movie_names
in query 10 skip the first 10 entries and fetch the next 5
Optional advanced question :- remove movie genre from the first 10 movies in query 10.

Note :- like yesterday you need to submit a text file with all the commands
